# 🚀 GSAP Animation Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects built using **[GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/)** — a powerful, framework-agnostic JavaScript library for creating high-performance, smooth, and professional web animations.

These projects helped me explore and enhance my animation skills by experimenting with different GSAP features, from basic tweens to advanced scroll-based interactions.
